# Hangman App
First mini-project. Small application with basic Java GUI that allows players
to play Hangman.

## Motivation
Want to learn how to code, and how to code really well. Figure this is a good enough place to start.

## Build status
Finished project.

## Screenshots

## Tech/framework used
Built in Java using Swing for GUI
code is messy because the project was originally meant to be based in the
text box. The entire HangmanApp.java could easily be removed and all functionality
moved over to HangFrame.java. Since this project is mostly finished ill come back
to that at a later time. Right now my priority is learning as much as possible in
as short a timeframe as I can manage.

## Installation
Works great when I run it in the IDE as a test.

## Credits
I learned the basics of how the program should work from the HackerRank [30 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code), but I stopped watching at around the 20 minute mark and completed the rest myself. Also, making the GUI was all me too
